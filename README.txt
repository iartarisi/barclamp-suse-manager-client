The Crowbar Framework (https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) was developed by the Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team (http://dell.com/openstack) as a OpenStack installer (http://OpenStack.org) but has evolved as a much broader function tool. 
A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality for Crowbar.  Core barclamps operate the essential functions of the Crowbar deployment mechanics while other barclamps extend the system for specific applications.

* The functionality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar Framework is required. *


About this Barclamp: SUSE Manager Client
-------------------------------

This barclamp can be used to register nodes to SUSE Manager.

Steps to setup:

Install SUSE Manager Server.

Inside SUSE Manager, create an activation key. The activation key will be used in the barclamp's WebUI.

Download the `https://your-manager-server.example.com/pub/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-*-*.noarch.rpm` file (check the version number) as `chef/cookbooks/suse-manager-client/files/default/ssl-cert.rpm` (in this barclamp's directory tree).

Reinstalling the barclamp might be required in order for crowbar to take notice of the new file. Do this with:
`/opt/dell/bin/barclamp_install.rb --rpm suse-manager-client`

Now apply the barclamp from Crowbar's WebUI on selected nodes.
